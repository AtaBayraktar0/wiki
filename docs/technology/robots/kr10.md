## Setting up RObot software on your computer (Rhino + PRC)

## Step-By-Step Printing Guide

### Before Printing

 - Make sure you read the checklist file.
 ![Checklist](/assets/images/KUKA10_1.jpg)

 - Numbers in the image are for the instructions below.
 ![Markdown](/assets/images/KUKA10_Markdown.JPG)
 
### Uploading the Document to KUKA 

 1. Power the arm using the green switch on the control box. This will also turn on the teach pendant. 
   ![Button](/assets/images/KUKA10_2.JPG)

 2. Load the .SRC file on the computer.

 3. Press the robot icon(8) and select PointLoader on the teach pendant. Select the HMI - Full Screen.
   ![PointLoader](/assets/images/KUKA10_3.JPG)

 4. Press the yellow folder icon(5) on the teach pendant and choose the uploaded file. You'll see the name of the file after you return to the main screen.
 5. Press the play button(6) next to the folder icon. This will load the file into the robot arm.
 6. Change the speed of the robot(4). It starts with 0 for safety.

### Airpass

 1. Change the Black switch(1) and choose T1.
 2. Hold the safety latch, press play and make sure the robot doesn't crush to itself or the printing bed. Then Press reset button(2).Select 'Reset Program'. Hold the play button(7) and return the robot arm to it's home position.
 3. Change the Black switch(1) and choose automatic.

### Controlling the Extrucion

 1. Turn the extrusion panel on by powering the electrical outlet under the robot arm.

 2. Wait for the nozzle to heat up to desired temperature. 

 3. Control the extrusion and fan rate using the knobs on the extrusion panel. 
   ![Panel](/assets/images/KUKA10_9.JPG)

 4. Wait until you get a steady extrusion out of the nozzle.

 5. Hold the safety latch and press the play button(7) to run the file.
 6. *PS* Make sure the extruder doesn't run out of pellets.

### Turning off After the Print

 1. Turn off the fans and extrusion after the print.
 2. Turn off the extrusion panel. 
 3. Shut down the robot using the following steps:
  - Press the robot icon(8) on the teach pendant.

  - Press "shutdown" and "Shutdown Control PC" respectively on the screen.

  - Turn the green switch off from the computer.





 

## Troubleshooting + [Calibration Guide](https://help."prusa"3d.com/category/calibration_199) 
- If the filament is not sticking to the printer bed, remove the sheet and clean it with rubbing alcohol.
- If you switch out a steel sheet for another type, make sure to re-calibrate the bed.
- If you notice the nozzle is touching too close or too far from the bed when printing, you can adjust the height of the nozzle by changing the z-axis in the printer's configuration or live adjust the z-axis while printing.

## Features

- Magnetic bed with swappable steel sheets:
  - For easy and quick 3D print removal.
    - 3 Types: smooth, textured and satin which do not require surface preparation (i.e., glue, tape)
  - The flexible steel sheets have a PEI powder coating.
  - The print bed can reach up to 100C.
- Optical filament sensor:
  - Enables automatic filament loading.
  - Lets the user know when the filament is running out and pauses the 3D print.
  - Detects filament jams and stops the 3D printing process.
- Power panic: if there is a power outage, the MK3 will go back to where it last left off when the power is back. This feature works without batteries.
- Sensing fans and Noctua: for more silence when 3D printing. Also, cooling from both sides of the extruder increases the 3D printer&#39;s overhang performance.
- New Y axis: gives the 3D printer a smoother look and a sturdier frame.
- Bondtech extruder: dual gears ensure a reliable grip on the filament to prevent filament from slipping. The extruder can reach up to 300C.
