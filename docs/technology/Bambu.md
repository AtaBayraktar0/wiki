## Loading the filament with AMS
- The AMS is located at above the printers, it can hold up to 4 rolls of filament.  
1. Open up the cover of the AMS and load the spool in slot 1. Grab the filament and push it gently into the grey tab in front of the spool. The AMS will
detect it automatically and start the loading procedure, when this happens you can let go of the filament.  
2. When using an official Bambulab filament spool, the information (type and color) will be filled in the touchscreen.
