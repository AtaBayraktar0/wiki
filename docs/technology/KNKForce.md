# KNK Force Vinyl Cutter
  
  ## Location

Main Lab

 ## Setup:

 ### Materials:
   - KNK Force
   - Charging Cable (has a sticker on it that says “KNK”)
   - WIFI Adapter or Ethernet cable 
   - Cutter blade
   - Cutting Mat
   - Pen (necessary for print and cut only)

 ### For WIFI Connection:
 Plug the device in and plug the WIFI adapter into it.

 ### For Ethernet Connection:
 Plug the ethernet and charging cable only.

 ## Connection:
   1. Press the start button.
   2. A blue light will blink (might take up to 1-2 minutes).
   3. Another light will appear after the blinking:
      - If it is Red: KNK doesn’t receive a connectable WIFI signal (WIFI adapter is required).
      - If it is Green: KNK is in recovery mode and needs a manual reset. See the instructions below.
      - If it is White: KNK is ready for the next step.
   4. Open WIFI settings from your PC and choose KNK_Force network.
   5. KNK is now connected to the PC.

 ## First Cut:
   - You’ll need an IP Address to start cutting. (The KNK with “Print and Cut sticker” has 10.0.0.1 as an IP).
   - IP address can be obtained by:
   - Plug an Ethernet into the machine and the PC.
   - Run Command Prompt on PC.
   - Type ipconfig and see the results of the Ethernet Cable.
   - Or
   - Connect KNK to WIFI.
   - Connect to the KNK via WIFI.
   - Download Angry IP and search for the device.
 ## Cutting:
   - After you get the IP, type it into your search engine.
   - An Interface for KNK will show up.
   - Prepare a design from Inkscape for cutting.

   - Select “Prepare this cutting job”
   - Adjust the starting position of your KNK using arrows and numpad (Depends on the mat and material size) 


 ## Setting up the Cutter/Pen tool:
