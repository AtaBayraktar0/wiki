2. Remove Spool from sealed packaging, place the dessicant packs inside drybox to further absorb moisture.  
3. Place spool on spindle and attach magentic cap.  
4. Place spool on drybox, making sure that the filament is exiting from the **top**
5. Feed the plastic filament all the way through the transparent tube at one end of the drybox until it reaches one end of the extruder. Let it hang freely for now.
